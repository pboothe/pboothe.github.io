                <p>C++ developer in charge of the market information software stack encoding and transferring market data

                and libraries used by more than 25% of production systems at 1000+ person company. Refactored the decade-old 
                information stack to increase flexibility and efficiency without forcing change on existing users. Held all 
                work to high efficiency standards, as wasted microseconds meant real monetary loss. Also did critical work 
                on: the metrics system; the logfile and packet-capture pipelines; the ETL system; and addressing packet loss 
                in intra-datacenter multicast feeds. Taught new-hire orientation classes in networking, multicast, and market

                <p>Became tech lead of the Measurement Lab project (a Vint Cerf-founded Google partnership with external 
                non-profit Code for Science and Society — <a href="https://measurementlab.net">https://measurementlab.net</a>) 
                when the project was six years old. Wrote the project mission, aligned the team with the mission, and 
                designed and developed software as a team in pursuit of that mission. Stewarded the world's largest open 
                database of Internet performance data (kept it open and grew it from tens of terabytes to more than 2 PB). 
                Grew the daily test volume from 15000 tests/day to millions, in large part by launching the "how fast is my 
                internet" feature to Google Search. By 2021, every day at least one of 1000 internet users used the speed 
                test and contributed data. Was responsible for the entire stack, from the bill of materials at each 
                datacenter and wiring diagrams for remote hands, up through Kubernetes with custom plugins and the 
                measurement services we ran, all the way up to the ETL pipeline that made the data available to the public. 
                Performed outreach to encourage data use and to get measurement racks into third-party colocations across the 
                world.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Is traffic on the Internet centralizing or decentralizing over time? How robust 
            is the Internet to various forms of political attack? To solve this problem I processed terabytes of data, proved 
            problems to be NP-complete, and discovered and developed approximation algorithms for those problems. I found 
            that Internet traffic is not decentralizing over time.</p>
